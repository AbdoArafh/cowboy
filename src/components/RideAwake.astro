            With your phone docked in sight, your bike becomes an all-knowing
            companion. Connected to your every move and on the lookout for
            what's ahead, now's your chance to wander and wonder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your next ride is no longer a question of if or when. Rather, where
            to? A swift first kick powers the speed you need for an active ride
            and an easy climb.
